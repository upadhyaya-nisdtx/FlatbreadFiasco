# FlatbreadFiasco: Computer Science 3 Capstone Project
The Dough Bros’ plan is to create a game that simulates running a pizza store. We were inspired by Papa’s Pizzeria games and want to make something similar with our own spin on it. The game will include an order station, a build station, an oven station, and will end with giving the order to the customer/delivery driver. The goal of this product is to provide entertainment to anybody who likes computer games and pizza. This product serves the audience by providing an engaging, digital source of entertainment that incorporates a popular food item.
